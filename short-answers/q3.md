# Question
What is polymorphism? Show an example in a code snippet.

# Answer
Polymorphism means "many forms".

Polymorphism is a concept in object-oriented programming where multiple types of objects share "signatures" (they have the same property and method names even if their values/implementations are different).

The impact of polymorphism is that our program can reliably use different types of objects in the same way if they all descend from the same parent class.

    Basically - Polymorphism is an inheritance from the parent class and it has the same method name but the functionality of the method is different (and or properties)

## Example Below
```js
// We did this for this assignmenttt
class Quadrilateral {
  constructor(side1, side2, side3, side4) {
    this.side1 = side1
    this.side2 = side2
    this.side3 = side3
    this.side4 = side4
  }

  getPerimeter(){
    return this.side1 + this.side2 + this.side3 + this.side4
  }
}


class Rectangle extends Quadrilateral {
constructor(side1, side2) {
  super(side1, side2, side1, side2)
}
getArea(){
  return this.side1*this.side2
}
}
```

In the code snippet above : 

There is a superClass of Quadriltateral
The class takes in 4 instances (side1, side2, side3, side4)
There is a method of `getPerimeter()` where tall the given sides are added up to return the perimeter of the shape

`Rectangle` is a `subClass` and the reason it is a subClass is because of the extends keyoword. We are reusing the side here
